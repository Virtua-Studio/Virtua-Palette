# RSDK-VT Palette Editor

Very basic GUI tool for editing RSDK-VT global and stage palettes.

### How to Use

1. Run the .exe
2. Click "Open"
3. Select the GameConfig.bin file in the data folder
4. Select the palette you want to change in the list
5. Modify the colours
6. Click "Save"

### Notes

- This is only compatible with RSDK-VT (i.e. Codename Virtua / RSDK-GDT), <B>DO NOT OPEN THE GAMECONFIG.BIN FROM SONIC 1 / 2 / CD / MANIA</B>
- Character fur colour is stored in the PlayerObject script, changing it here will not affect player sprites
